/**
 * Keeps track of a NUMBER of pending (unacknowledged) issued events. The parties are: synchronizer (1) plus each event issued.
 * So, we register each event as it is passed to the handler and deregister it when it is confirmed (with any status).
 * And, finally, the synchronizer arrives and waits for all the pending requests.
 *
 * Assumes that no event is acknowledged twice.
 * Currently not used; {@link IndividualEventsAcknowledgeGate} is used instead.
