# The file contains 5 data columns (`uid`, `givenName`, `familyName`, `dateOfBirth`, and `nationalId`.
# Note that `uid` has to be a pure integer. The accounts are processed in the order of their `uid`.
#
# The `test` column describes the expected identity of the account:
#
# - `new` means a new identity should be assigned (e.g. new user in higher-level tests, or
# new reference ID in lower-level ones)
# - `=N` means the account corresponds to the same identity as previously processed account with uid `N`;
# - `?A,B,C:N` means that the correlator/matcher should provide options corresponding to accounts with `uid`
# values of `A`, `B`, `C` (can be any positive number of them) and the operator will select the account
# with `uid` of `N`
# - `?A,B,C:new` means the same, but the operator will select "new person" as the response
#
